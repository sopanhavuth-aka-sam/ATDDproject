		<h2>Organization of the Manual</h3>
			<p>
				This User Manual contains all essential information for the user to make full use of 
				the Acoustic Telemetry Data Display (ATDD). This manual includes a description of the 
				system functions, capabilities, and step-by-step procedures for system use.  Use graphics 
				as a reference to our instructions where possible. The manual format may be altered if
				another format is more suitable for the particular project.
			</p>
		<h2>System Overview</h3>
			<p>
				Since 1966, when the shark lab was established at CSULB, it has studied physiological and 
				behavioral ecology of not only sharks but marine life in general. Not only to educate and
				further our understanding but to emphasize the effects of human activity on marine life
				and take action to conserve and restore depleted populations. The Acoustic Telemetry Data
				Display is a web based application that will display visual representations of marine life
				movement along the California coast. The shark lab has set up over 100 receivers along the
				California coast to record date, time, and id of tagged sharks and fishes. This data can be 
				used to plot a point on a map to pin point the location of any particular fish at the time
				when the fish is detected. The data collected by the receivers will be used by the ATDD system 
				to allow the user to see points on a map where certain species or individual fish have been 
				spotted. This system will help field professionals, learning institutions and the general public 
				further their knowledge about marine life behavior. The system will be specifically useful in the
				understanding of movement and migration patterns and what causes them. Focusing particularly in
				the influence of human activity, the ATDD system will help people understand how things like 
				offshore oil platforms and contaminants influence the movements and migration of fish along the coast.

				<h3><li>Picking Species and/or Individual</li></h3>
					<p>
						The first step in using ATDD is by selecting species and/or individuals. 
						By clicking on <b>Track</b>, on the top left corner, the Track menu opens. Here we click on the drop down menu of <b>Select Species</b> we can pick what species
						to display. Moreover, we can select individual species by clicking on the <b>Select Individual</b> drop down menu. 
						Here we can select any individuals from the selected species to display on the map.
					<p><i>
						Note: <b>Selecting individual</b> is not a mandatory field to generate the map animation.
					</i></p>

					</p>
				<h3><li>Picking Dates and Setting the Time Frame</li></h3>
					<p>
						The next step is to pick our starting and ending date. First we click on <b>Start Date</b>
						field and pick our starting date.  Similarly, we click on <b>End Date</b> field to pick
						our ending date. Next we have to decide our time frame. We can pick our time frame 
						by simply clicking on one of the four options: <b>Hourly</b>, <b>Daily</b>, <b>Weekly</b>, and <b>Monthly</b>. 
					<p><i>
						Note: It is recommended to pick a larger time frame if your start and end dates are
						too far apart. If not, then the animation could be considerably longer.
					</p></i>

					</p>
				<h3><li>Generate</li></h3>
					<p>
						After filling out all the required fields, such as: <b>Select Specie</b>, <b>Start Date</b>, <b>End 
						Date</b> and time frame, we can click on <b>Generate</b> button to produce our animation. 
					<p><i>
					<center><image src="http://imgur.com/GTezybZ.png" alt="Generate"style="width:75px;height:30px;"></center>
						Note: There will be a warning sign if there is a missing field(s). 
					</p></i>

					</p>
				<h3><li>Start the Animation</li></h3>
					<p>
						Our next step is clicking on the <b>Start</b> button. You would notice that the map is 
						being adjusted accordingly and our detections are being generated on the map. 
						You can pause the animation anytime by clicking on the <b>Pause</b> button.

					</p>
				<h3><li>Details</li></h3>
					<p>
						As you may have noticed by now, there is a <b>Details</b> section to our interface. During
						the animation, we can hover our mouse over any of the detections to get more information
						such as: <b>Date, Time, Latitude</b> and <b>Longitude</b> of that detection.  
						<center><image src="http://imgur.com/sMmDyjq.png" alt="Details"style="width:351px;height:216px;"></center>
					</p>
				<h3><li>Clearing the Map</li></h3>
					<p>
						After generating and playing the animation, you can reset the map by clicking on <b>Clear</b>
						button to clear all the field.
